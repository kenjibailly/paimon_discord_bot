# 🤖 Paimon Event Bot

The idea is that game events will be held outside of Discord. One team goes against the other. The winning team gets awarded tokens through a slash command performed by the staff.

Those who want to join the game event can react to a message and will be added towards the random team generation. A total of 2 teams will be randomly generated.

Award tokens to roles, all users in that said role will get their tokens. Users can then use their tokens for various rewards using the shop.

After X amount of time, the reward will be removed and can be configured in the settings.

❗Extra: AI image generation using ComfyUI

### 🌀 Discord Developer Portal

<details>

<summary>🛠️ Open for installation steps</summary>

Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) and create a `New Application`.

Under the `Installation` tab, find `Guild Install` at the bottom, add `bot` to scopes and add `Administrator` to permissions.

Under the `Bot` tab, find `Privileged Gateway Intents` and enable:

- `Presence Intent`
- `Server Members Intent`
- `Message Content Intent`

Now we will fill in the .env file we created.

- Under the `General Information` tab, find `Application ID` and click copy. Paste it in your .env file after `APP_ID=`.
- Under the `General Information` tab, find `Public Key` and click copy. Paste it in your .env file after `PUBLIC_KEY=`.
- Under the `Bot` tab, find `Token` and click reset token, copy it. Paste it in your .env file after `DISCORD_TOKEN=`.
- Under the `OAuth2` tab, find `Client Secret` and click reset secret, copy it. Paste it in your .env file after `DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=`.

Now invite your Discord bot to your server.
Under the `OAuth2` tab, find `OAuth2 URL Generator` and check `bot` under the scopes, then check `Administrator` under the bot permissions. Now find `Generated URL` at the bottom of the page and copy the link. Open the link in your browser and invite the Discord Bot to your server.

After completing your .env file please restart the docker container, if you don't do this you won't be able to add the interactions endpoint URL in the next step. Discord will give you an error.

```bash
docker restart discord_bot_paimon
```

</details>

### 💾 Register Discord Slash Commands

<details>

<summary>✅ Information</summary>

The slash commands are automatically registered when the bot enters the server.

When you update the bot you can register the slash commands again with the `/register-slash-commands` command. You have to do this per server the bot is in.

> The Discord client has to be refreshed before the change in the slash command(s) get updated. `ctrl + R` on windows. Restart app on mobile.

</details>

### 👾 Discord

<details>

<summary>🛠️ Open for installation steps</summary>

Go to `Server Settings` > `Roles` and move the bot's role to the top of the hierarchy or it will have permissions issues.

Optional: Change the permissions of the commands of the bot. Go to `Server Settings` > `Integrations`, find the bot under `Bots and Apps` and click on `Manage`. Configure each command's permissions to your preference.

</details>

### 🖼️ Optional: ComfyUI for AI image generation

<details>

<summary>🛠️ Open for installation steps</summary>

Install and run ComfyUI, I'm not going to explain how to do this, there are a lot of different ways.
Add your ComfyUI address to the `.env`file, more information in the comments in the `.env` file.

The workflow is made to generate anime images. If you want to use another model or tweak some options, you can change the workflow in the AI folder.

Download Pony Diffusion V6 XL:
https://civitai.com/models/257749/pony-diffusion-v6-xl

Add it to your ComfyUI models folder.
It should have this name, but double check or it won't work: `ponyDiffusionV6XL_v6StartWithThisOne.safetensors`

---

The bot is configured to be able to use the slash commands: `/create-image` and `/create-image-settings` everywhere when you add the bot as an app. If you don't want this, then edit `/commands/deploy-commands.js` and remove these lines from the constants `CREATE_IMAGE_COMMAND` and `CREATE_IMAGE_SETTINGS_COMMAND`:

```js
    "integration_types": [0,1],
    "contexts": [0,1,2],
```

Also remove these 2 lines:

```js
    await InstallGlobalCommands(process.env.APP_ID, [
      ...(process.env.COMFYUI_ADDRESS ? [CREATE_IMAGE_COMMAND, CREATE_IMAGE_SETTINGS_COMMAND] : []), // Register both commands globally if COMFYUI_ADDRESS is set
```

---

⚠️ In development, the settings are not used in the workflow yet

In `/AI/data.json` you can setup the models, loras and dimensions.
The loras and dimensions are configured per model as this varies and you might want to limit these for lower end GPUs.

Example:

```json
{
  "SDXL": {
    "dimensions": {
      "1:1 square": "768x768",
      "3:4 portrait": "672x864",
      "5:8 portrait": "624x912",
      "9:16 portrait": "576x1008",
      "9:21 portrait": "480x1152",
      "4:3 landscape": "864x672",
      "3:2 landscape": "912x624",
      "16:9 landscape": "1008x576",
      "21:9 landscape": "1152x480"
    },
    "checkpoints": [
      {
        "name": "Pony Diffusion V6 XL",
        "file": "ponyDiffusionV6XL_v6StartWithThisOne.safetensors",
        "description": "Pony Diffusion V6 is a versatile SDXL finetune capable of producing stunning SFW and NSFW visuals of various anthro, feral, or humanoids species and their interactions based on simple natural language prompts.",
        "link": "https://civitai.com/models/257749?modelVersionId=290640",
        "settings": {
          "cfg": 7,
          "steps": 25,
          "sampler_name": "euler_ancestral",
          "scheduler": "normal",
          "clip_skip": -2,
          "positive_prompt": "score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, anime",
          "negative_prompt": "low-res, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing xfingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, xlow quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, xwatermark, username, blurry, artist name,(deformed, xdistorted, disfigured:1.3), poorly drawn, bad anatomy, xwrong anatomy, extra limb, missing limb, floating limbs, x(mutated hands and fingers:1.4), disconnected limbs, xmutation, mutated, ugly, disgusting, blurry, amputation"
        },
        "default": true
      }
    ],
    "loras": [
      {
        "name": "Aesthetic Anime V1",
        "file": "aesthetic_anime_v1s.safetensors",
        "description": "Enhances the aesthetic style of anime creations.",
        "link": "https://civitai.com/models/295100/aesthetic-anime-lora",
        "model_weight": 1,
        "clip_weight": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can add multiple checkpoints to use with multiple loras with the same dimensions.
You can add new objects with a different appropriate name, in our example: `SDXL`. This name is not used anywhere and only used for better visibility in the json file. This means you can name this anything you want.
When you create a new object like this, you can specify different dimensions and loras you might want to couple with these checkpoints.

You need to set a default checkpoint to be used in case the user hasn't configured any.
You can do this by adding `"default": true` to your checkpoint. Make sure only one checkpoint has been set to `true`. The other checkpoints should be set to `"default": false`.

The list is made by the staff. The missions could include things like: create an embarrassing picture, create an artwork, or touch grass for example. When the user has completed the mission, the staff can accept by clicking a button generated by the bot. The message of the user is then sent to the channel where `bot channel` is configured. The troll is then lifted and the user gets access to the server again.
